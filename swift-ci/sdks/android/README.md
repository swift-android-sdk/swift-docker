# Dockerfile-based build for Swift Android SDK

This is a Dockerfile-based build set-up for the Swift Android SDK.

To build the Docker container and run the 

```
$ docker build -t swift-android .
```

This folder contains scripts to build a Swift Android SDK 
in the form of an artifactbundle.

## Running

The top-level `./build-docker` script installs a host toolchain and the
Android NDK, and then invokes `scripts/fetch-source.sh` which will
fetch tagged sources for libxml2, curl, boringssl, and swift.

It then applies some patches and invokes `scripts/build.sh`,
which will build the sources for each of the specified
architectures. Finally, it combines the NDK and the newly built
SDKs into a single artifactbundle.  

## Specifying Architectures

By default all the supported Android architectures
(`aarch64`, `x86_64`, `aarmv7`)
will be built, but this can be reduced in order to speed
up the build. This can be useful, e.g., as part of a CI that
validates a pull request, as building a single architecture
takes around 30 minutes on a standard ubuntu-24.04 GitHub runner,
whereas building for all the architectures takes over an hour.

To build an artifactbundle for just the `x86_64` architecture, run:

```
TARGET_ARCHS=aarch64 ./build-docker
```

## Installing and validating the SDK

The `.github/workflows/pull_request.yml` workflow
will create and upload an installable SDK named something like:
`swift-6.1-RELEASE_android-0.1.artifactbundle.tar.gz`

The workflow will also install the SDK locally and use
[swift-android-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/swift-android-action)
to build and test various Swift packages in an Android emulator.
