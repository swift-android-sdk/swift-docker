#  Swift Android SDK: Toolchain source variables
#
# ===----------------------------------------------------------------------===

# This script is meant to be sourced from another script that sets the
# BUILD_VERSION environment variable to one of "release", "devel", or "trunk"
# and will set check the latest builds for each build type in order
# to provide information about the Swift tag name in use and where to
# obtain the latest toolchain for building.

# TODO: we could instead use the latest-build.yml files for this, like:
# https://download.swift.org/swift-6.2-branch/ubuntu2404/latest-build.yml
# https://download.swift.org/development/ubuntu2404/latest-build.yml
# but there doesn't seem to be one for the current release build.
